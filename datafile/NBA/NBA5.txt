Russell joins coaching staff


(March 5, 2002) -- The Toronto Raptors announced Tuesday they have re-assigned scout Walker D. Russell to the coaching staff for the remainder of the 2001-02 season. Russell joins Jim Brewer and Craig Neal as assistants to head coach Lenny Wilkens. 

The Raptors have been without the services of a third assistant coach since late December when Stan Albeck left the team for medical reasons. Russell is in his sixth season as a scout with the Raptors. 

He is responsible for scouting the Midwest and Eastern parts of the United States, as well as some Continental Basketball Association games. As a player, Russell saw action in 155 games in the NBA, splitting his time with Atlanta, Detroit and Indiana. 

He will be on the bench for tonight’s game between the Raptors and the Houston Rockets

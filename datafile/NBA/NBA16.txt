Raptors Announce 2002-03 Season Ticket Pricing


(June 20, 2002) --- The Toronto Raptors announced their season ticket prices for the 2002-03 campaign Thursday. Tickets for season seat holders at Air Canada Centre will be scaled from $20 to $152. More than half of the seats will be priced at $68 or less, with more than 27 percent capped at $24. 

Our pricing remains in the middle of the pack among NBA teams,?said Chris Overholt, vice president of sales and service for Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. “However, the costs of doing business and competing successfully in the NBA increase each year. We attempt to off-set those costs in numerous ways and ticket price is one area that helps us to address this challenge.? 

The Raptors are coming off a year in which they advanced to the postseason for the third consecutive campaign, losing to the Central Division champion Detroit Pistons in an exciting opening-round series. The club earned new fans throughout the NBA by displaying great character in overcoming widespread injuries, including those to All-Star Vince Carter, late in the season while winning 12 of its final 14 games to reach the playoffs. 

Toronto sold out 40 of its 41 regular season home games last season. The schedule for the 2002-03 season is expected to be announced by the NBA in mid-July. For more information, fans can call (416) 366-DUNK.

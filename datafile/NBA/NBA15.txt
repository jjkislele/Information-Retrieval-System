Clark Given Qualifying Offer

(June 28, 2002) --- The Toronto Raptors announced Friday they have made a qualifying offer to restricted free-agent forward/centre Keon Clark. Under the rules of the collective bargaining agreement, Clark would have become an unrestricted free agent July 1 had the Raptors not tendered an offer. 

As a restricted free agent, Clark can receive contract offers from other teams, but the Raptors have the right to match and retain his services. 

Clark, a four-year NBA veteran, averaged a career-best 11.3 points and 7.4 rebounds during the 2001-02 season.

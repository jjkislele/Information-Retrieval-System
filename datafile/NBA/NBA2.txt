Curry Out With Back Ailment


(March 27, 2002) --- The Toronto Raptors announced Wednesday that guard/forward Dell Curry will be sidelined a minimum of two weeks with a bulging disc in his lower back. Curry has been affected by back spasms over the past two weeks. 

The 15-year NBA veteran was forced to leave the past two games due to reoccurring spasms. He started Sunday’s game versus Washington and played nine minutes before sitting out the remainder of the contest. 

Curry will remain on the active roster, along with Vince Carter, who underwent arthroscopic surgery yesterday on his left knee, because the Raptors are at the league limit with three players on the injured reserve list. Tracy Murray (back spasms), Mamadou N’diaye (right foot plantar fasciitis) and Michael Stewart (hernia) are currently on the injured list.

Jazz sign Lopez

September 26, 2002 --- Utah Jazz Vice President of Basketball Operations Kevin O'Connor announced today that the team has signed Raul Lopez to a three-year contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
"I am very happy to finally join the Utah Jazz," said Lopez, "It's always been my dream to play in the NBA. Although I'm very disappointed with the injury, surgery will allow me to enjoy a long career in the NBA."

Lopez, a 2001 first round pick from Spain played in just four games for Real Madrid of the Spanish League in 2001 before suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He returned to finish the season, but reinjured the knee in an exhibition contest with the Spanish National team that was preparing for the World Championships in Indianapolis this past summer.

He is scheduled to have surgery in Salt Lake City on Saturday (September 28) and will most likely miss the entire 2002-2003 season. A medical update on his surgery will be provided to the media within the next two weeks. 

The 6-0 point guard began his professional career with the Juventut Badalona junior team in 1996-97. In 1997-98 he played for both the Juventut junior team and Festina Juventut, the Badalona associated team. In 1998-99 he made his debut in the ACB League (Spanish pro basketball league) with Juventut Badalona and played through the 1999-2000 season. The following season (2000-01) he was signed by Real Madrid.

He was a member of the Spanish Junior National Team that won the 1998 European Junior Championship and the 1999 World Junior Championship and a member of the Spanish National Team that won a Bronze medal at the 2001 European Championship. He also played for Spain in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

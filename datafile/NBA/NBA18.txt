Carter To Undergo Surgery

(March 22, 2002) --- Vince Carter will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee early next week in Toronto, the Raptors announced Friday. He will miss the team’s Friday night game in Cleveland and Sunday’s home game with Washington prior to the surgery. Carter has battled a knee problem since early February, and it grew progressively worse during the past month. Doctors have determined the condition of Carter’s left knee has continued to deteriorate and have recommended surgery. 

"For Vince to continue to play would risk a more serious or chronically debilitating injury, so we need to take care of this now," said team physician Dr. Paul Marks. "Unfortunately, the knee hasn’t responded the way we hoped through the process of conventional daily therapy." 

"Vince has shown great determination and dedication in giving his best effort to help our team during the last few weeks," said Glen Grunwald, senior vice-president and general manager of the Raptors. "His desire to continue to play through the injury speaks highly of his commitment to the team and to our fans." 

Carter averaged 24.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 39.8 minutes in 60 games during the season. He missed seven games in February with the knee injury, which also forced him to miss a starting assignment in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game in Philadelphia.

The Board of Scrutiny and the Consultative Committee


The powers delegated to the two principal executive bodies, the Council and the General Board, have been extended in recent years. This has been balanced in the new constitution by re-affirmation of the role of the Regent House as the ultimate governing body of the University. It is acknowledged as the body to which the Council and other bodies are explicitly accountable, and to enforce this accountability the Council now submits an Annual Report to the Regent House which, with the Annual Estimates and Accounts, is subject to examination and public review on behalf of the Regent House by a new body, the Board of Scrutiny. This Board consists of the Proctors and Pro-Proctors and eight elected members of the Regent House none of whom may hold an administrative office, or be members of the central bodies.

Unlike almost every other British university apart from Oxford, there is in general no explicitly 'lay' element in Cambridge's government, such as that represented by the 'Courts' of the civic universities. In order to involve non-academic opinion and experience more fully in the policy-making of the University, a Consultative Committee has recently been established. Its nine members (six of whom may not be members of the Regent House) are appointed by the Council. Their role is to give advice to the Council especially on the objectives and methods of the University and its relationship with the wider world.

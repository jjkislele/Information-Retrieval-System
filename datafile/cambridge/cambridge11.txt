Foreword


The University of Cambridge is a complex organisation, but that is to be expected in an institution nearly eight hundred years old, made up of over one hundred disparate component parts, and with wide-ranging and long-standing procedures for representation, consultation and decision-making. Yet the University also has remarkably open and accessible legislative and administrative arrangements, once they are explained and understood.

This Guide seeks to widen such understanding. It explains in simple terms the principal elements in these procedures, and defines some of the terms used in a special sense in Cambridge. It is not an authoritative statement of the University's Statutes, nor of the legal position in relation to the rights and duties of any body or bodies.

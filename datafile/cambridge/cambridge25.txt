Specialist Courses


The University's prestigious Board of Continuing Education (now Institute of Continuing Education) offers the following courses throughout the year to the general public:

short residential courses in specialist subjects at sixteenth-century Madingley Hall


evening and day sessional classes of ten or twenty weeks at various centres in the region


day schools at a variety of centres in the region


study tours abroad 
The Board also provides International Summer School programmes offering short-term study opportunities to both overseas and British students, with accommodation in Cambridge Colleges.

The Board of Continuing Education also runs, through the Cambridge Programme for Industry, an advanced programme of short courses aimed at practising scientists, engineers and managers in industry and business. This programme of post- experience courses enhances the links and interchanges between research and teaching in the University and their application in industry, commerce and the professions. It also generates new contacts and leads to new opportunities for growth and development.

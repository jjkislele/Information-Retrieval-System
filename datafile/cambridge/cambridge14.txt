The Council


The Council (formerly called 'the Council of the Senate') is the principal executive and policy-making body of the University. It has overall responsibility for the administration of the University, for defining its mission, for planning its work, and for the management of its resources. It deals with relations between the University and the Colleges, conducts negotiations with outside bodies on many matters (other than those relating directly to the educational and research programme of the University, which are dealt with by the General Board) and is responsible for the appointment or nomination of certain members of internal and external Committees, and for many student matters, apart, of course, from the selection of entrants, which is a College concern.

The Council consists of

the Chancellor (if he wishes to attend); 
the Vice-Chancellor (as Chairman); 
and nineteen elected members in the following classes:

a.four elected from amongst the Heads of Houses; 
b.four from amongst the Professors and Readers; 
c.eight from amongst the other members of the Regent House; 
d.three from amongst the students of the University (one must be a graduate student). 
Members in classes (a), (b), and (c) are elected by the Regent House. Members in class (d) are elected by the student body under rules of procedure determined by Ordinance (i.e. by Grace of the Regent House).

In addition the Council has a Finance Committee (see below), and a Planning and Resources Committee to advise it on strategic questions and the allocation of University funds.

The Registrary, as he or she is termed at Cambridge, is head of the University Offices, and Secretary of the Council. The Registry Division of the University Offices deals with the business of the Council as well as the conduct of examinations and the maintenance of student records. In addition the Registrary is the principal administrative officer of the University.

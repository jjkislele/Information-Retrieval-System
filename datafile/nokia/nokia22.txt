(September 04, 2002) 



  
Nokia and German operator HanseNet Telekommunikation GmbH have signed a frame agreement for the supply of the Nokia DX 220 digital switching platform for HanseNet¡¯s Hamburg city network.

Cooperation between Nokia Networks and HanseNet goes back to 1998 when Nokia supplied the first DX 220 switches to the Hamburg-based city carrier. The new DX 220 supply agreement now allows HanseNet to further expand this infrastructure base.

Petra Rennings, HanseNet Account Manager, Nokia Networks, points out the numerous benefits of the Nokia switching solution; ¡°The DX 220 switching platform supports fixed network applications from PSTN/ISDN to Intelligent Networks and also offers a growth path to broadband applications,¡± she says.

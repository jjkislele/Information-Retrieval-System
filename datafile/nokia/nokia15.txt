Nokia Receives Frost & Sullivan Market Engineering Award 

(August 27, 2002) 



Frost & Sullivan, an international market training and growth consulting firm, today recognized Nokia, a world leader in mobile communications, as winner of the 2002 Market Engineering Market Penetration Award in the wireless segment of OSS Service Assurance and OSS Service Fulfillment. 

To determine the winner of the Market Penetration Award, Frost & Sullivan analysts interviewed market participants and end-users and conducted extensive secondary research to track sales and brand awareness efforts over the past two years. The deserving company demonstrated excellence in product innovation and marketing and sales strategies, resulting in the largest market share gain. 

Nokia leads the wireless segment of the Service Assurance and Fulfillment markets. Nokia offers a variety of support services and options, as well as its NetAct Framework for supporting future IP based networks, in order to provide mobile operators advanced solutions in the quickly changing business environment. 

Nokia develops wireless Operations Support Systems (OSS) products internally and with partners and therefore tends to be closer to the market's requirements than others," explains Jim Alsman, Frost & Sullivan OSS Program Leader. "By offering a suite of differentiated products unmatched by other companies, Nokia can attract and satisfy customer requirements better, therefore expanding and fortifying its market reach. By using open-interfaces and de facto standards, Nokia can incorporate additional or differing features into its products much faster than its competitors who must rely on the 'persuade' approach." 

"Nokia is honored by Frost & Sullivan's Market Engineering Award," said Jorma Häkkinen, Vice President and General Manager of OSS, Nokia Networks. "This award highlights the value of the unique combination of our network and service management solution - Nokia NetAct."

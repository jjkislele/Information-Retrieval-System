FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking: 14 August 2002 

The devaluation of past results allowed Spain (3rd, up 1) to inch ahead of France (4th, down 2), which held the top ranking going into the 2002 World Cup, but then failed to advance to the second stage. Argentina maintained its second-place position. Other teams to profit include England (7th, up 1) and Italy (9th, up 1). 

Iraq (60th) defeated Syria twice to move up eight places in the August rankings, but the Mover of the Month title belongs to the newly crowned Oceania champions, New Zealand. The All Whites, now in 47th place, gained a massive 41 points after defeating Australia (46th) in the final of the prestigious Oceania Nations Cup. 

The new index value, which takes into account a team's strength as well as the number of points gained, reveals no surprises -- New Zealand and Tahiti made the largest strides forward. But, in the race for the "Best Mover of the Year" award, New Zealand remains in fourth place, behind Senegal, Brazil and Cameroon. 

The next FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking will be published on 18 September 2002.

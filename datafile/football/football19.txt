Surgery rules out Filipescu
Thursday 19 September 2002 


Romania are likely to be without central defender Iulian Filipescu for the EURO 2004?qualifier against Norway in Bucharest next month. 
Root of the problem
The Real Betis Balompi?player is to undergo surgery on Monday in a bid to cure him of persistent leg injuries and is a major doubt for the Group 2 tie on 12 October. Doctors hope to deaden a nerve in his back which, they believe, is the cause of his problems. 

'A lot of pain' 
"It is causing me a lot of pain and I don't think I will play against Norway," said Filipescu, who has missed all but one of Romania's games this year and is ruled out of Betis's UEFA Cup tie against FC Zimbru Chisinau tonight. "I'm sick of missing so many games," he said.

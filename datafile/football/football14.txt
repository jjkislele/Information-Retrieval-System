Hedman misses out on Hungary
Thursday 26 September 2002 

Sweden goalkeeper Magnus Hedman will miss the EURO 2004?qualifier against Hungary on 12 October because of injury.

Calf injury
The Celtic FC player tore a calf muscle during a fitness test at the club yesterday. "The physician told me I'll be out for four to six weeks," Hedman said. "The injury came at the worst possible time."

'Banal and incomprehensible'
Hedman was having the fitness test after having recovered from an earlier calf muscle injury sustained before a league match two weeks ago against Hibernian FC. "I can accept getting injured badly at an important game, you can sacrifice yourself for the team," he added. "But getting injured in a jump at a fitness test is banal and incomprehensible."

Seconds out
Andreas Isaksson, of Djurgårdens IF FF, and Mattias Asper, of Malm?FF, are the two likely replacements for the game against Hungary, with second-choice Magnus Kihlstedt of FC København also out of action until November with a thumb injury.

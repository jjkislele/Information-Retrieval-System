Injury ends Dadason's season 
Friday 27 September 2002 


Iceland striker Rikhardur Dadason is out for the rest of the season after sustaining a serious knee injury while playing for Lillestrøm SK against FK Bod?Glimt. 

No operation needed
"My doctor says that it will take from six to eight weeks to heal, and then the season is over," said Dadason. "The good thing, though, is that I don’t need an operation." 

No Iceland duty
The injury will keep Dadason out of his country's EURO 2004?European qualifying matches against Scotland and Latvia on 12 and 16 October. "These are matches I dearly would have loved to play in," he said. "They are our two first matches in the qualifiers and I think that Icleand have a better chance than ever to succeed after Scotland's poor start." The other teams in EURO 2004?Group Five are Germany, Lithuania and the Faroe Islands.

Worst possible news
With Lilleström aiming to stay clear of relegation this year, the injury is a major blow for last season's runners-up in Norway, who have not been out of the top flight since 1985.  Dadason, who recently arrived from English club Stoke City FC, has formed a successful partnership with German forward Uwe Rösler.

Ceh returns from suspension
Thursday 26 September 2002 


Slovenia coach Bojan Prasnikar has replaced Ermin Rakovic with Nastja Ceh in his 20-man squad for the forthcoming Euro 2004?qualifier against France in Paris. 
Back from suspension
Club Brugge KV midfield player Ceh, who missed the 3-0 Group 1 win against Malta through suspension, is recalled at the expense of Rakovic. But the NK Maribor player is on stand-by along with Zoran Pavlovic (SV Austria Salzburg) and Adem Kapic (Ferencvárosi TC) for the 12 October fixture at the Stade de France. 

Comfortable win
While Slovenia eased their way to a comfortable opening success against Malta - Ermin Šiljak and Sebastjan Cimerotic adding to Darren Debono's first-half own goal in Ljubljana - France had to come from behind to beat Cyprus 2-1 in Nicosia, Sylvain Wiltord and Djibril Ciss?sparing the European champions' blushes. 

Slovenia squad
Dabanovic, Simeunovic, Bulajic, Cipot, Knavs, Vugdalic, Mavric, Acimovic, Filekovic, Gajser, Karic, Pavlin, Radosavljevic, Šukalo, Zahovic, Zlogar, Cimerotic, Ceh, Šiljak, Ipavec.

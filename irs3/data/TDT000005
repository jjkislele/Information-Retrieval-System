  
Let us go live right now to the Palestinian border city of Rafa. This is a city that straddles the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. And we believe we are seeing the beginning of the motorcade carrying PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat to Gaza for the first time in 27 years.

  We see a huge throng being held back - or at least, efforts being made to hold back the throng by a small army of the newly-created Palestinian police and military forces. All this takes place amid a sea of the red, black, green and white Palestinian flags so long banned in those territories.

  CNN Correspondent Bill Delaney is covering the story also. He is about a 45-minute drive away from Rafa in Gaza City, and that is where Arafat is headed. Bill, are you able to see what is going on there now?

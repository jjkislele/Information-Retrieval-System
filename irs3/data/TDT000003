   Football legend O.J. Simpson bought a stiletto knife with a six-inch blade and had it specially sharpened almost six weeks before his ex-wife and a male companion were stabbed to death, witnesses testified Thursday.  Los Angeles television station KNBC reported Thursday night that part of a knife was found in a waste collection tank at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and police were investigating whether it was the one used to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 

  Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the double murders, boarded a plane for Chicago June 12 shortly after the time authorities believe the two were killed.

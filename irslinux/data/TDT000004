  
First, this late development. Chicago authorities are reportedly preparing to turn over part of a knife to Los Angeles police so they can determine if it was used in the murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. And joining us on the phone to give us more information on that, Lisa Howard of Chicago Department Aviation Authority. Mrs. Howard?

  
Good evening.

  
Good evening.

  
Thank you so much for joining us. Could you tell us exactly what was found?

  
Yes, this evening at about 10 o'clock, American Airlines maintenance workers found a portion of a knife - that being a handle and part of the actual blade of a knife in a waste pit where lavatory trucks dump their waste.

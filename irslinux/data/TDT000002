   The World Bank said it and major donor nations agreed Thursday to work with the Palestinians to come up with the estimated $7 million per month they will need to police the Gaza Strip and West Bank city of Jericho. 

  In a statement issued after a week of talks with a PLO delegation here, the Bank pledged its support for Palestinian self-rule and for improving living standards in the region.
